&lt;subtitle class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;How A Bad Video Game got me into speedrunning&lt;/subtitle&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-sucked-in&#34;&gt;Getting sucked in&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I got into a certain Hot New Trend in speedrunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking Mama: Cookstar (for Nintendo Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t kept up, Cookstar is the Cooking Mama game so bad it got pulled from sale and the license holder - Office Create - talked about legal action against the developer. It&amp;rsquo;s wild and while I won&amp;rsquo;t be recapping &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, I recommend you go take a skim of the Wikipedia page if you&amp;rsquo;re curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest is something I aspire to be, so, full transparency - I&amp;rsquo;m not being creative here. The amazing Laura Kate Dale (@LauraKBuzz on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch, YouTube, Patreon, etc) posted the following, on January 7th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Surprise daytime stream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to try and perform a world record speedrun live on stream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s become the world&amp;#39;s fastest Cooking Mama: Cookstar (All Vegetatian Recipies - Any %) player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, I&amp;#39;ll be the only time listed, still counts.&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Ze3GjKifhm&#34;&gt;https://t.co/Ze3GjKifhm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/9eWAH7OQUb&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9eWAH7OQUb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Laura Kate Dale (@LaurakBuzz) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1347134615690088448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On first glance, I saw this, thought &amp;ldquo;haha, that&amp;rsquo;s funny, all the best&amp;rdquo; and tuned in for a little bit before having to close my browser to go to a meeting. When I returned post meeting, and Laura (still on the same run) mentioned that she would love for someone to challenge her time, I took it upon to challenge her, live, on Twitch, to a new time. Is this what ten months of pandemic brain does to a woman? Sure. But, my streams are usually about four hours long, and, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a time at least I could say I came second and it would be a funny addition to a Twitter bio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up to SpeedRun.com, ordered a Chef hat, and posted the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;HELLO.&lt;br&gt;TOMORROW.&lt;br&gt;7PM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will attempt to take &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@LaurakBuzz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Cooking Mama Cookstar All Vegetarian Recipes 3:54:56 on Twitch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a chef outfit (if it arrives on time)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I&amp;#39;ll most probably fail but it&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty funny regardless!)&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/zuEOFeW767&#34;&gt;https://t.co/zuEOFeW767&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_VKni?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@_VKni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Val the Anime Rival Cookstar (@VallerieKnight) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VallerieKnight/status/1347619079843143684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;challenging-what-i-thought-speedruns-were&#34;&gt;Challenging what I thought speedruns were&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading into this I thought speedruns were things people who &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; loved a game did, and required great skill - the kind of persom who runs the same level of the same game for years, to get tenths upon tenths of a second of improvement. This kind of thing, to be frank, scared me a little - making my speedrun.com account felt like the equivalent of diving head first into a boulder trained in mixed martial arts. I saw dozens upon dozens of people on the Cooking Mama 2 leaderboard, all of whom were competing to be at the very top, with times in the couple of minutes or less on the (admittedly, very entertaining to watch) &amp;ldquo;Burn A Pie%&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of &amp;ldquo;enjoying the game as something else&amp;rdquo; hit like a brick during the first run I did - it was something which was a whole lot of fun which I did not expect to have with such an awful game. From joking about the carrots just being stretched diamonds, to the wonderful art someone in my chat produced (which I am so gracious for - a link to the tweet with the art + their Twitter should be linked below, check them out!), it was strangely one of the best times I had playing games in such a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VallerieKnight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@VallerieKnight&lt;/a&gt; Congrats on your Cooking Mama world record time! It was a fun being there with ya! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/S0Qn2GVdMO&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/S0Qn2GVdMO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Miss Genki Art (commissions open) (@MissGenkiArt) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MissGenkiArt/status/1348041614493552640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-competition&#34;&gt;The Competition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this, I kinda was a little worried by competing - I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to upset anyone by taking their times, and I certaintly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to step on anyone&amp;rsquo;s toes by being the Weirdo who @s you on Twitter implying &amp;ldquo;Haha I&amp;rsquo;m better than you at video games 😆🤭&amp;rdquo; when in fact I just wanted to see if I could get a good time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has stuck out is how far this worry has been from what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the handful of people competing have always seemed to be welcoming of new times. Receiving the news that Laura &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; got a sub 13 on 5 recipes was amazing - even though I got beaten, it meant we knew for sure that we could go further, and continue to get the most out of this pretty bad video game. The joke about me being Laura&amp;rsquo;s anime rival is entertaining to me, a little out of being confused as to how I got here, but also amazement into how far this healthy back and forth has gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The welcoming of new times set by others is something I at least love, as they give me motivation to load the game one more time, listen to that obnoxious music, and see if I can one up Laura or Dan and get back to the #1 spot. Even those playing other Cooking Mama games (like the mods of the leaderboards) have been incredibly lovely and welcoming - something that&amp;rsquo;s a stark contrast to many other competitive scenes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to stumble into in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was how good it was not only to compete in times, but compete in knowledge - finding out the new skips and sharing them feels equally as good (to me) as getting a new time, and I&amp;rsquo;m just as proud of my discoveries. Figuring out the differences between &lt;code&gt;v1.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;v1.0.2&lt;/code&gt; of the game &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have felt horrible as it led to my times getting de-listed, but I was welcoming my times getting delisted with open arms as something &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; helped research went into that decision!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedrunning Cookstar has been so much fun. Even if my times right now aren&amp;rsquo;t looking like the best, I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go get them down (at some point). That might just be the fact I enjoy repetitive actions, but I also do enjoy the healthy sense of discovery from this. Beyond that, creating a (however small) bit of joy and entertainment for people has been so fun - talking back and forth with chat, defending my controversial opinions about Mario 3D World being more enjoyable than Mario Galaxy (a hill I will die on) or even just providing the antagonist character for whenever the anime adaptation is picked up by Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if right now, I&amp;rsquo;m going off and playing actually &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; games, I&amp;rsquo;m so glad, for a few hours, I could truly call myself the Cookstar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning the following people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LauraKBuzz&#34;&gt;Laura Kate Dale&lt;/a&gt; for kickstarting the popularity of veggie any% 50 recipe category, and for being such a wonderful competitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Super_NinDando&#34;&gt;Super_NinDando&lt;/a&gt; for wandering in as the third amazing competitor, and developing procon slicing strats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My good friend 
&lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(0);&#34; onclick=&#34;alert(&#39;He doesn\&#39;t use Twitter or other public social media, sorry!&#39;)&#34;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;  who is partially the reason I bought this awful garbage game in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Switch homebrew scene for developing the tools I used to remove updates from the game and do research - shoutouts to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere&#34;&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/XorTroll/Goldleaf&#34;&gt;Goldleaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate&#34;&gt;https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone who I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned who has been following along, whether on twitter or in my Twitch chat for being good company during these four hour streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Transphobia and the Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-06/transphobia-and-the-internet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 11:58:38 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-06/transphobia-and-the-internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(heads up, kind of a long post which I wrote most of at 1am)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the past week, you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; seen an author who wrote a book with magic in (I think - I half read one of them as a kid then went back to reading A Series of Unfortunate Events) say some really not so nice things about trans people. Short version of how this then went: she got mass criticism, doubled down, got even more criticism from her co-workers, and then wrote a follow-up blog post. In this post she said some REALLY horrific things about trans people (of which I won&amp;rsquo;t be directly responding to - that&amp;rsquo;s not the point of this, and honestly, won&amp;rsquo;t do the world much good if I did) but also described abuse she experienced. Just to have it on the record, and, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe some tabloids don&amp;rsquo;t get this - abuse is fucking awful, and I hope as a survivor she has managed to get some kind of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that little note out of the way, from here on, I&amp;rsquo;m not really going to be referencing the bad things she wrote, or even mention her name. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about my experience of being trans in the last week, and then move onto my general experience of being trans online, and my frustrations with how this discourse has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve logged into Twitter, I see trending a celebrities name with &amp;ldquo;Also trending: Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; and at once I want to log back out. If I come onto Facebook, I&amp;rsquo;ll see my friends having to argue with people they knew from their hometowns about this. If I go onto Instagram, all my stories are referencing The Bad Thing and posting screencaps of the Bad Thing. I know, before I&amp;rsquo;ve clicked on the trending topic that it&amp;rsquo;s going to already have devolved into an absolute shitshow, where us trans people have been forced into defending our own humanity and cis people will be making funny jokes getting 1k+ RTs about how the sorting hat creator is a transphobe. Meanwhile &amp;ldquo;GC REALITY TRUTHER 🏁 XX&amp;rdquo; is out here saying my very existence is predatory and that deep down I transitioned not because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have another option, but instead because I secretly have a perversion and want the rest of society to indulge me in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While us trans people get this kind of transphobic BS every other week at this point now, this is somewhat different. Hell, even my poor mother who uses Twitter to keep up with the cross-over she has of archeology and Shakespeare has had a chat to me in the kitchen going &amp;ldquo;Wow that author really is a piece of work isn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo; and about how she&amp;rsquo;s had to unfollow people she thought were decent (slight aside: my Mum is great, and the best ally I could ever have. &amp;lt;‍‍3‍‍). With this, I also understand that for cis people a lot of you don&amp;rsquo;t get that we&amp;rsquo;ve experienced Miss &amp;ldquo;GC REALITY TRUTHER 🏁 XX&amp;rdquo; on Twitter for years at this point, as that&amp;rsquo;s not really part of your daily twitter experience. As such, you don&amp;rsquo;t see her when she pops up in the replies to a nice tweet about trans things. You also don&amp;rsquo;t see her in said replies trying to imply that transfem people are wanting to hurt someone, transmasc people are confused and misled, or that non-binary people simply are lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of shit burrows DEEP into your mind if you see it enough. People who know me know I&amp;rsquo;ve been single for, gosh, I think 2 years at this point? Up until now, the big reason has been &amp;ldquo;oh haha, you know, dysphoria&amp;rdquo; even though, since I started hormones my dysphoria isn&amp;rsquo;t present most days. Instead, one reason for me struggling to be okay with dating even after 2 years is the portrayal of transfem people being inherently evil and predatory, which then makes it &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; hard to even feel okay going on a date with someone. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard for me to be in a relationship when everyday I&amp;rsquo;m being told by the glass hell-slab I hold in my hand that it&amp;rsquo;s dangerous for me to do so. This is the real impact of this kind of transphobia being spread around - not only does it aim to hurt our rights, it aims to have real impacts on our own thinking. These thought processes are personally going to be being extremely difficult to unlearn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, it&amp;rsquo;s also been 5 years since I came out to a wider group of friends as trans (give or take a couple of weeks). Throughout this, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to do with my transness being a source of stress. For about 3.5 years, it was me battling to get access to blockers, then trying to battle to get hormones, and since January this year, it&amp;rsquo;s now been a battle to try and keep access to that health care, all while trying to cope with harassment that came my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been my daily reality for years at this point to go from having to try and defend my own access to health care to logging into Twitter and seeing people try to rip even the lackluster care I had as a young trans person away from the current youth having their very first GIDS appointments. I want to be shouting from rooftops about how best practice means GIDS should be prescribing blockers at first appointment if they want to allow trans kids a safe space to explore identity (as, turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to explore identity while going through the traumatic experience of the wrong puberty) but instead, I&amp;rsquo;m being forced to defend GIDS even existing to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, while I&amp;rsquo;ve appreciated seeing my cis friends come out to say they disagree with the wand aficionado, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found it somewhat tiring. We&amp;rsquo;ve been telling you for years about the warning signs with these people. We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to tell you how to be good allies to trans people for years. Seeing you only publicly come out and dunk on a transphobe because it&amp;rsquo;s the trendy topic tells your trans friends that you do care about them, but only when it&amp;rsquo;ll get you likes and retweets, and in the process, making your trans friends see the thing they&amp;rsquo;re already so, so tired of. Me avoiding mentioning the magic school author&amp;rsquo;s name, or any of the content of her posts isn&amp;rsquo;t just me having a bit of a giggle (albeit it&amp;rsquo;s been very fun coming up with ways to refer to her) - us trans people are far too used to cis people amplifying transphobic voices so cis people can have their fun making jokes. It happened this week, it happened last January with the DK64 livestream (even though my feelings there are different, given that it supported charity and highlighting many trans voices, ultimately helping people), and yet we don&amp;rsquo;t see this level of attention being given to trans people when they are begging for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to alienate any cis people here. Instead, I want to ask you to do something simple. Listen to your trans friends. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a tough fucking road ahead, with the GRA reform looking to be not great, the future of health care for trans kids being as stable as my emotions during lock-down, while the Equality Act is probably next on this government&amp;rsquo;s agenda of things to wreck. The transphobes are going to become even more vocal and organised than they already are after this, so we need this kind of energy you have right now making jokes about a Scottish billionaire writer, so that us trans people don&amp;rsquo;t have to be doing even more work for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, listen to your trans friends, and speak up, even when it&amp;rsquo;s not the cool thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trans Day of Visibility 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-04/tdov-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:45:47 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-04/tdov-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For context, and why this isn&amp;rsquo;t as well written, I wrote this at 9pm straight onto my Facebook wall. I am so so sorry for the weirder writing style than I try to keep to here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(CW: trans NHS mentions, bigotry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;ve left this late, but, feel like I should write something for TDoV (for those not aware, Trans Day of Visibility). I started with maybe going for something, happy, or, celebrating trans people &amp;amp; charities who do amazing things but, personally, all I have is just disappointment with a side serving of anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of context here: my very first TDoV I spent while on some kind of waiting list for GIDS (the gender identity clinic for the under 18s). This year is also the first year I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;celebrating&amp;rdquo; (? idk if that is the right word, but, let&amp;rsquo;s go with it) TDoV on hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, TDoV has always had something to it which hurts, whether it being on the (looking back, not that long) 5-ish month waiting list, or battling GIDS to actually give me access to medication, to having to wait in limbo on blockers.
I want to say, this year is different, and that this is the first year I can truly just be happy about my transness, and say &amp;ldquo;I managed it!&amp;rdquo;, however doing that feels off? Like, idk, yeah, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; made it, but I got extraordinarily lucky with that, with my parents being absolutely amazing, being one of the lucky few who even got blockers with GIDS, fighting GIDS to not discharge me while on blockers, and thankfully got access to hormones before the current virus situation kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know people who have been fucked over by all of those. I know people right now who came out at the same time I did, but, had to wait until now with the much longer waiting list because of unsupportive family. I know people with supportive families but who &amp;ldquo;weren&amp;rsquo;t trans enough&amp;rdquo; for so-called medical professionals. I know people who were screwed over for letting not masking their neurodiverseness in their GIDS appointment and got discharged.  I know right now people who thought they would be getting hormones before they turned 20 in May being screwed over by pure incompetence, pushing him back 2 months into March, now facing even more awful months without that essential medication due to the current situation in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (read: I) often say our transness isn&amp;rsquo;t a debate, but, some people have, and continue to force it to be one. That&amp;rsquo;s the politicians who try to demonize transfemme people as predators, portray trans men as being simply confused, and non-binary people as being attention seekers, but also the &amp;ldquo;professionals&amp;rdquo; at GIDS+ GICs who deny autistic trans people access to hormones. That&amp;rsquo;s the people who shout and scream at you in the street, but also the cis person who tries to question your community&amp;rsquo;s own terminology as if they know better. That&amp;rsquo;s the people who say they support the transes, but not those silly non-binary people, and, to the trans people who then reassure those bigots just to cash in on their anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a closing that&amp;rsquo;s nice and well written (it&amp;rsquo;s me, so of course I&amp;rsquo;ll make some pretentious ramble on Facebook at 9pm at night while I have more important things to be doing) but, I can sure make some bullet points for people to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cis people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to the trans and non-binary people you know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the above, but Actually Do It This Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve listened, campaign for trans and non-binary people in the ways they want. Be an ally not by trying to lead the charge, but, by understanding what is needed and how you can be useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention, and, learn the dog whistles, so you don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally succumb to transphobia - there are so many dog whistles transphobes are using at the moment that may sound reasonable to you, but, are a way to sneak in transphobia - the current big one is &amp;ldquo;protecting women/girls&amp;rdquo; (you may see this in stories about detransitioners that get heavily pushed in the news, or, through campaign groups using this as an argument to stop trans people from using services for the gender they are) and &amp;ldquo;experimental chemicals being used on children&amp;rdquo; (this is to prevent things like blockers being prescribed to under 18s, even though the blockers themselves are well tested).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans and non-binary people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to be amazing, and if it&amp;rsquo;s safe for you to do so, continue frustrating the bigots by just existing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get there, I swear, even if times are rough right now (like yes, I know I did go on a rant but, if this gal who&amp;rsquo;s life is primarily concerned with trying to catch a shark in animal crossing can do it, so can you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look after yourselves right now - it&amp;rsquo;s been rough for us for a while, so even if it&amp;rsquo;s just for an hour or so, get away from the absolute shitstorm (for me, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a new Twitter just to follow cats on - highly recommend for when you just need to jump out of the world for a few seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a happier note, all of you, stay safe and remember you&amp;rsquo;re amazing. It&amp;rsquo;s rough out there at the moment, but, we can get through this, together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Wanted to Do Photography</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having thoughts for a while about how the compsci community has a really nasty feeling towards the arts. For example, the amount of jokes about arts degrees landing you a job in a coffee shop and that compsci is the One Good Field is frustrating to no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;14-year-old-vallerie&#34;&gt;14 Year Old Vallerie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back, to 14-year-old Vallerie. I just got my first proper camera and fell in love with it. The photos were kinda bad, even for a 14-year-old, but even then, it was such a freeing thing, especially as I&amp;rsquo;ve never been big into painting or drawing. Going into college, I so badly wanted to do Photography. So badly. But, because I did well in Maths and Physics, I felt the pressure on me to do STEM things instead. Every time I heard of friends talking about their photography projects they were doing in class, I felt my soul get absolutely crushed, as, that was something I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bad-approach-to-teaching&#34;&gt;Bad Approach to Teaching&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kinda seeped into changing my feelings about the narrative of &amp;ldquo;We should teach kids to code!&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s been pushed by the government here in the UK for about the past 10 years, while cutting school budgets (with the arts always being the first to feel this tightening of budgets).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.valknight.xyz/images/personal/i-wanted-to-do-photography/guardian.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Screenshot of a guardian article titled &amp;#34;Coding at school: a new parent&amp;#39;s guide to England&amp;#39;s computing curriculum&amp;#34;&#34;   /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;right&#34; &gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/04/coding-school-computing-children-programming&#34;&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/04/coding-school-computing-children-programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always told that kids need to learn to program because it helps with &amp;ldquo;problem-solving&amp;rdquo; and that we &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nEeD mOrE grADuATes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Personally, I think this is horrific. We should teach things because knowledge is valuable, not because big companies want new fresh code machines to sit at a desk and write another frontend for a database all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-to-do&#34;&gt;What to do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, given the state of UK politics (very not good), I doubt this will change soon. As such, us compsci folks need to do more to promote cool projects that support the arts. One thing I adore is the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://processing.org&#34;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt; which aims to promote &amp;ldquo;software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology&amp;rdquo;. This leads me into killing the awful stigma we have towards the arts, and specifically, those pursuing the arts at academic institutions like universities. (People who do/have done creative things as your degree or as your job, you&amp;rsquo;re HELLA COOL and I love all of you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapping this up, this is a very long and disjointed way to write if you are in the same position of 14-year old Vallerie, and have a skill you so desperately want to pursue, do it. Please. You will love every moment to take to yourself to do what you love, and being happy is so much more important than &lt;em&gt;problem-solving skills&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to charge up my camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- vallerie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[she/they]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS, I mentioned it, but seriously, check out Processing/P5.js - they&amp;rsquo;re very cool little projects, and, good to have a mess around with when you have free time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tautulli, an Inky pHATs, and 6 hours while on holiday.</title>
      <link>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-01/tautulli-inky-phats-holiday/</link>

      <guid>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-01/tautulli-inky-phats-holiday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a few others, I run Plex Media Server for me, and close friends + family, and, I also run the absolutely amazing Tautulli server. I&amp;rsquo;ve messed around with Tautulli&amp;rsquo;s API in the past, but, never to any good extent. My most used function of Tautulli is actually the graphs, as it lets me see how well used the server is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only issue is, you have to open up a web browser, log in, and go to the graphs page &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time you want to look at this - we&amp;rsquo;re in the roaring 20s now, this cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;approach&#34;&gt;Approach&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat?variant=12549254938707&#34;&gt;Pimoroni&amp;rsquo;s Inky pHAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little e-ink display I&amp;rsquo;ve used before now to show stats for a Minecraft server, and to show system uptime, and I adore it - the library is fantastic, as it just lets you push an image on it, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be rendered in fantastic 212x104 resolution, with a whole 3(!) colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcasm aside, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of it. It&amp;rsquo;s a cheap e-ink display with a Python library that&amp;rsquo;s easy to work with. As such, I thought &amp;ldquo;how hard could it be?&amp;rdquo; to get the graph from Tautulli, and put it on my Inky pHAT - after all, Tautulli has an API, and I can pull the data, make a graph in python, and put said graph into an image and show it on the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.valknight.xyz/images/inky_phat_tautulli.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;A graph showing tautulli activity on an INky pHAT&#34;   /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;right&#34; &gt;The Pi itself &#34;mounted&#34; on a wall with some tape.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, and, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valknight/tautulli-inkyphat&#34;&gt;tautulli-inkyphat&lt;/a&gt; is on GitHub. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to set up, and, for light-medium Plex users, it should suffice. It assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve already set up the libraries for the Inky pHAT (which takes 5 minutes tops! Check Pimoroni&amp;rsquo;s latest installation guide for advice). You can then use &lt;code&gt;crontab&lt;/code&gt; to set up a schedule to run &lt;code&gt;main.py&lt;/code&gt; on, and you&amp;rsquo;ve now got an updating graph!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the prettiest but, it works very well for me and &lt;strong&gt;I now have a cute little graph that&amp;rsquo;s easy to read!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-inky-phat&#34;&gt;Getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; - this has the setup described for the python library&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The first post</title>
      <link>https://www.valknight.xyz/posts/2020-01/first-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all - this is the first post I&amp;rsquo;m making here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this space mainly because I&amp;rsquo;m annoyed at all the other options for putting my words make me hand my soul over to some shady company. While GitHub is no better (oh BOY they&amp;rsquo;re not better), at least here, I can take this site to another host relatively painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to be doing more creative things in the future. I want to have a play around with Processing and see if I can make anything cool with that, which I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that&amp;rsquo;s me out! Have a great day all of you, and hope to be writing here soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Vallerie&lt;/p&gt;
