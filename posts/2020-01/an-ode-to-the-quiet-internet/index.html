    <h1 class="article title">An Ode to the Quiet Internet</h1><p class="article date">2020-01-07</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><h1 id="resolutions">resolutions</h1>
<p>With new years, we all know of resolutions. I used to say I disagreed with the concept - often they&rsquo;re <strong>pushed</strong> onto us - things like losing weight, going to the gym. I don&rsquo;t want to do either. I&rsquo;m kinda lowkey happy not doing either.</p>
<p>This year though, I did make a resolution. I didn&rsquo;t do it actively, and, I kind of started it before the new year as well, but, I&rsquo;m calling it a resolution so I can join in. I&rsquo;m trying to get onto quieter bits of the internet. the internet <strong>I want</strong> to use. So many people talk of burnout of social media, and for me, it&rsquo;s not that - I love the people on places like twitter, and the close friends I don&rsquo;t see nearly enough I can still talk to on Facebook.</p>
<p>I hate the companies who PUSH things into my eyeballs. I hate the idea that every click, every interaction and every message <em>may</em> be used to build some weird thing about me. I don&rsquo;t want that. I want to talk to my friends. I love my friends with all my heart.</p>
<h1 id="volume">volume</h1>
<p>I describe this commercial internet as the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; internet. I use this, because, it&rsquo;s similar to how I approach the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; world. I like being in the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; world (I.E parties, clubs, etc&hellip;) not because I like the environment, but, I love hanging out with the people in my life I love. I much prefer quiet spaces - chilling with people on my sofa, or, being with a friend in a cafe, both of us reading our own books.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;loud&rdquo; internet I describe as places like Facebook, or Twitter. I love being there, because, loved ones! However, quiet spaces? They are so more my jam - spaces where, it&rsquo;s okay if I take some time for myself, or, work on my own things while having a little off-beat conversation.</p>
<p>My issue with the internet is, even in the past few years, the volume dial has been slowly turned up. Originally I had Tumblr - a space, where, I had my own blog, with people who only knew me by that username was idyllic. A friend then recommended me a site called &ldquo;Reddit&rdquo;. I loved it! It was the close community of Tumblr, just, without needing to break through the barrier of needing followers first.</p>
<p>The best bit was talking to people, similar to me, on small subreddits where there would be, maybe, 10 posts a day, if that. Those same spaces now have 100k+ subscribers, and Reddit itself feels a more scary place, with tracking, and it being ever more apparent people who don&rsquo;t like people like me can and might well be watching my account.</p>
<h1 id="turning-it-back-down">turning it back down</h1>
<p>Back to the bit about accidental resolutions - late last year, I had the great idea of starting a blog (that&rsquo;s this!). It would be MY space, to post project-y things, as well as just my general thoughts.</p>
<p>However, this is all great, but, the quiet internet shouldn&rsquo;t end at things like blogs. little, peer-to-peer messaging affairs would be so cool! It&rsquo;s the difference between having to click to load an image (not, a blurred box where an image is) and bright interfaces with self-destroying messages.</p>
<p>I know this is a rambly post, but, over the last month or so I&rsquo;ve had thoughts about it. I&rsquo;m also trying to ensure anything on here is also longer, or, justifies being in this fancy place. for the more weird, off the wall stuff, I have an account on tilde.town now - my page is <a href="https://tilde.town/~valerokai/"target="_blank">here</a> (if you are also there, shoot me a message! love talking to people who also use things like this)</p>
<p>stay safe y&rsquo;all, and, hope you have a quiet and calm 2020.</p>

<p>PS: am still going to be using the loud internet, in the same way I still go to parties! Just, if you want to get hold of me, maybe shoot me a text message or a telegram instead of a Facebook message, as I&rsquo;m trying not to overwhelm myself as much as I did last year.</p>
